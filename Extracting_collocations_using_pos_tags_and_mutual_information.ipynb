      "13 year old fps fan speaking here and you have my word that this is one of the best fps this fan has played ever. The graphics are very good, if not sloppy at some times,and the sounds are better than Ghost Recon. The fact that there is no blood is not a bad thing, it just means that more people will play it.The AI acts smart and stupid at the same time, the snipers must have auto aim on because they can hit you when you are showing a milimeter of your body. The multiplayer is ok,it has it's moments, but it has nothing on Wolfenstein, But if you compare the single player to Wolfenstein there is no comparison, Medal of Honor is the total winner.I love the d-day mission.\n",

      "If you have a high speed modem you will be playing this until the end of time.  My only complaint would be a lack of multiplayer maps.  But other than that this is a fun game.\n",

      "Use to play this sooo much back in the day. One of the best mutliplayer WW2 games ever made. Online is kind of dead now though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like this game. Lots of action, shooting and getting shot. Overall, great graphics and game play. I recommend this game to anyone who likes shooter, first person shooters and military games. My rating 5 stars and a thumbs up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow... this game is going to be a milestone.  It's going to be legendary.  Really, the gameplay is incredible, excellent character movements, reactions and superb AI.  Your buddies and the enemy are very cunning.  The graphics are beautiful, attention to lighting and textures, animated foliage.  There has been talk about being able to take a lot of hits before you die- not so if played on HARD settings.  You'll be lucky to round the corner without a bullet in your head. In any case, this game totally, completely beats the pants off that garbage game Op Flashpoint,(whats all the hype?)  and Ghost recon.  If you like pointy, square, cheesey landscapes and bad renditions of characters, poor voices, realy bad gameplay  and a game that eats up all your machines memory and still looks and plays ..., buy Op flashpoint or Ghost Recon.  wanna have fun playing a piece of art? Buy Medal of Honor-\n",

      "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is arguably the best first person shooter game for the PC. It's two predecessors, Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Underground don't even compare with the gameplay, texture, or graphics that the computer enhances. Allied Assault brings a whole new array of weapons into play. You can control more artillery, and a wide variety of authentic WW2 weapons to help defeat the Nazi war machine. You also get to take place in biggest operation ever: Operation Overlord, a.k.a D-Day. With a lot of help from your allies, the Nazis don't stand a chance of defeating you.The only minor annoyance that I know of is that the enemy is such a good shot. And I'm sure those who have played the sniper level will agree with me.Bottom Line: Medal of Honor does it again\n",

      "I DOWNLOAD THE DEMO AND IT WAS FUN AND HARD EVEN IN THE EASY MODE I GOING TO BUY THE GAME SOON THIS MONTH AND PLAY IT ONLINE.I HAVE A E-MACHINE PROCESSER INTEL CELERON D 2.80GHZ 256MB ram AND A 64MB VIDEO CARD AND IT RUN GREAT EVEN ON MEDIUM SETTING BUT THE LOAD TIME WAS LONG BUT ONCE YOU GET INTO THE GAME IT WILL BE GREAT NO LAG AT ALL.\n",

      "Wow. Really, a great game. The graphics are good, but even at 800x600 with medium details the SP game starts to slow down, at least it does on my computer: P3 866 with 128 sdram and an nVidia TNT 2 m-64. But with a P4, same or higher ram, and a Geforce 2 GTS or better, this game should be smooth. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars: the HARD difficulty. On the easy skill setting, you should be able to get through the game in about 28-32 hours. But bump up to Medium and your looking at probably 34+ hours. And on Hard, well, forget it. Unless you are an avid FPS player, you will probably need about 56+ hours to complete it. As probably everyone else is saying, the Omaha Beach map is SWEET. The multiplayer version is sort of a let down, as the spawn points can start past the fence, and two of the MG42s from the SP game were removed. (a good thing? possibly)This game has an enormus amount of web community, so explore the web and find whatever you need for the game.Speaking of Multiplayer, get into small (4-12 players)games and get your teammates to work with you or for you and you will suddenly find that the homework you were planning on doing will have to wait for study hall that morning.......\n",

      "This game is really good! There's a lot of competition between WWII shooters out there, but I have to say this one is somewhere in the top 3. D-Day is a great mission, the best one. And there are other fun ones that can really challenge you. I have a lot of fun playing this game, I dont really know what all the complaints are all about. People say &quot;The enemy seems to spawn out of nowhere&quot;, do you really care where the enemy runs at you that much? Kinda sad, but anyway, just have fun mowing them down, dont pay attention to where they come from, jeez. The last level is really a good one, I wont give out too many details, but it really puts what you've learned from the other missions to the test. Good game, good buy, not as bad as some people say it is.\n",

      "If you look at all the potential problems with playing MOH: AA four years after its release, there are some substantial ones.  It's quite outdated, and after playing newer games like Pacific Asault, the Call of Duties, and Brothers in Arms, it certainly looks and feels it's age.  It's also extremely unrealistic (wait, you mean that level where I have to infiltrate the German sub-base, blow up the sub, and kill 8,000 Germans on the way out didn't actually happen?).  The AI are not very smart.  There is no flanking, counter-flanking or anything close to that.  The German soldiers have their positions and tasks and never deviate from them.  AA is extreeeemley linear, one path, one destination, 400 million enemy soldiers standing in the way....So why the hell is this game still a blast to play?AA is simply classic.  It is the first of its kind to depict World War II combat in a realistic fashion (like Saving Private Ryan was to war movies.)  Despite its age, the levels are still one hell of a ride to blast your way through.  It's James Bond meets War, and the result could not be any sweeter.  I usually get bored when it's one faceless enemy after another in video games, but AA changes up the scenery and mission objectives to keep you on your toes and ramp up the suspense and difficulty factor each time.  While I do abhor the infamous sniper level (which game makers took a whole bunch of flak over), it's quite satisfying to finally get through it and I can unpeel my face from the computer screen and sigh in relief.  That damn train depot level with the five different machine gun towers still gets my heart pounding, wondering when a searchight might spot me.  The scope and ferocity of the Omaha beach level may never again be replicated by a video game.  I have played through that level at least 20 times just for the sheer thrill of it.  The entire Battle in the Bocage is a fantastic campaign, requiring some careful maneuvering and flanking.Say what you want about MOH: AA's senior citizen status, but it will forever remain a staple in all serious war gamers collections.  While the battles may not play out like newer glossier war games, all I can say is that Allied Assault keeps me glued to the screen for hours each time I pop it into my computer.\n",

      "I guess this game is getting to be `old hat', but that doesn't make it any less impressive, IMHO.  Everything about this game is superbly done.  The environments and interaction with the other characters is completely engrossing.  The music is awesome.  The sound can genuinely scare you.  Attention to historic detail is commendable (nobody's ever perfect here - it's a game, after all).  My only complaint is that there isn't anything more difficult than `Hard' - once you map out the action the missions can seem repetitive and the play value at this point is increasing difficulty.  Some of the enemy characters are a bit slow on the draw once you know the drill.  Still, re-playing familiar missions is kept from getting truly boring by the variability in the other characters' movements, etc.This game is an awesome achievement and a great deal of fun to play.  Very highly recommended.  The Spearhead expansion pack is equally well-done.\n",

      "MOH Allied Assault is a great 1st person shooter game and I really was impresssed with it. Yet I would advise you to read the following so as to decide wether you want to purchase it or not:1. Requires a very fast computer with atleast 256MB Ram, 700Mhz and a Very Very good Video card if you want to really experience the charm of the game.2. Different from the PS2 version. The PS2 Version is way better!!3. Moderate Graphics..Nothing Great!!Similar to the prior MOH games!4. No Blood and no Gore. Takes away the fun of killing the Nazis!!In conclusion if your computer meets the above listed requirments, If you can deal with the moderate graphics and if you can forget blood and gore, GO GET IT BABY!!\n",

      "Being a veteran of first person shooters like Quake and Half-Life, I put a lot of stock in how frightening a game is.  For that reason, I've always been skeptical of war games.  After playing Medal of Honor, I've changed my mind.  Medal of Honor's strengths lie not in fast action and jump-out monsters, but in atmosphere, cinematic gameplay, and strategy in combat.If you've ever wanted to be in a war movie, this is the game to play.  Many of the missions seem to be taken straight from Saving Private Ryan, and the feel of that movie is replicated with amazing accuracy.  At times, the game literally plays like a movie, including superior officers shouting orders to you and fellow soldiers dying in front of you.  Everything adds to the atmosphere, from the extremely well-done and realistic levels to the weather effects like rain and snow.  Even the music, which is half heroic, half chilling (sounds kind of like Star Wars meets Danny Elfman) adds to the feel of the game, though I find sometimes playing with the music off adds to the chilly realism.The gameplay is different than other, more fast-paced shooters.  It forces the player to be cautious and tactical, always running for cover from machine guns, looking over their shoulder, or listening for that distant sniper.  The player must play the role of sniper, shoot enemies from the back of a jeep, drive a tank, destroy tanks with a rocket launcher, call in air strikes, go on covert missions, and even pose as a german officer.My only real complaint is the complete lack of gore.  The game is enjoyable enough without it, but for a game that tries so hard to mimic graphic films like Saving Private Ryan and Enemy At The Gates, it seems silly when you shoot someone and not a single drop of blood falls.  I feel its one of the only things that stops this game from being truly perfect in its realism, but not enough to keep me from giving it five stars and highly recommending it.\n",

      "...is electronic 'crack'.  I am not joking.  I enjoy the 'Sims' games but am not a giant fan of them; however, this game...?  UNBELIEVABLE.  I could not stop playing it the first 2 days I had it.  I actually skipped 2 days of work (...cough cough...  sick boss, sorry...) and played the he** out of it!  I cannot wait to play the full version.  The role playing elements are great, I can see that there will very likely be scenarios and specific challenges in addition to the career and 'tycoon' aspects of the game.  This game Roxor!\n",

      "If you like sports, you'll like this game.  If you liked the Sims and you like sports, you'll love this game.I'm not the biggest Sims fan, but this game can be played in many different ways.  First of all, think of it as &quot;Golf Tycoon&quot;.  You're offered a basic golf design system and a budget and away you go.  But that isn't all.  You'll find that you take the role of the course pro and actually play the holes you design.  Hey, it ain't Links Pro, but it is fun.Tournaments and pro challenges come after you've started to maintain a club membership base.  Make some alterations to your course to make it suitable for pro play.  Or, make it easier for non pro golfers.  It's your course, so do what you want.Also, you have many different geographical locations to choose from, so the replay value is very good.With all the options and the way to play your course, this game will be yet another prize winner from two of PC gaming's legends, Sid Meier (Pirates, Railroad Tycoon, Civilization) and Will Wright (Sim City, Sim Tower, Sims).How can you lose with all these factors?\n",
      "\n",
      "While you read this review you are missing out on valuable time you could be playing this game.  This game by the makers of The Sims is on par with fun.  You make a golf course then you can change the holes, or even play your own golf tournament.  That is right; you can play your own golf course as you could with Roller Coaster.  It is like 2 games in one.  This game also has many different possible courses so replay is endless.  You also don't need to look for those codes to get more money; there is a mode where you can play with infinite money where you try to get your fun and skill rating up.  You can even sell homes to Movie and Music Stars on your golf course.  I knew that the programmers at EA were having a lot of fun creating this game when a &quot;Britney Agulara&quot; bought one of my lakeside homes.  I also enjoyed playing a 9 hole tournament against a &quot;Fuzzy Navel&quot;.  I am not joking if you play this game, you will come across many funny names including the ones I have mentioned here.  This game is a lot of fun!\n",
